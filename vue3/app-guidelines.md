It is designed for senior engineers and technical leads who are responsible for establishing architectural standards and leading development teams. The following are the key recommendations:Architecture: Adopt a modular, feature-centric architecture scaffolded with Vite. This approach, which leverages the Composition API and Single File Components (SFCs), promotes high cohesion and low coupling, making the codebase scalable and maintainable.State Management: Employ a dual-strategy for state: use Composables for local, co-located, or feature-specific state to maximize encapsulation and performance. Reserve Pinia for truly global, shared application state (e.g., user authentication, application settings). This strategy avoids over-centralization and clarifies data flow.API Layer: Implement a centralized, type-safe API layer. This involves a pre-configured Axios instance with interceptors for handling global concerns like authentication and error handling. Critically, all API responses must be validated at runtime using a library like Zod to create a robust boundary between the application and external data sources, preventing data corruption and runtime errors.Testing: Implement a multi-layered testing strategy aligned with the testing pyramid. Use Vitest for fast, in-memory unit and component testing of business logic (stores, composables) and component contracts (props, emits). Use Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) tests that validate critical user flows across the entire application stack. These tests must be integrated into a CI pipeline as a mandatory quality gate.Security: Prioritize security from the outset. For authentication, adopt a hybrid token management strategy, storing long-lived refresh tokens in HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies and short-lived access tokens in memory. Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks, and sanitize any user-provided HTML with a library like DOMPurify before rendering.Tooling & Automation: Enforce code quality and consistency automatically. A combination of ESLint (with plugins for TypeScript and security), Prettier, and Husky git hooks ensures that all code committed to the repository adheres to predefined standards, reducing review friction and maintaining long-term codebase health.Architecture OverviewA robust architecture is foundational to a scalable and maintainable application. The recommended approach is a modular, feature-oriented design that emphasizes a clear separation of concerns. This model ensures that different parts of the application—UI, state management, business logic, and data fetching—are decoupled and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.Conceptual Model & Data FlowThe following diagram illustrates the primary components of the proposed architecture and the flow of data and control between them.Explanation of the Data Flow:User Interaction: The flow begins when a user interacts with a Page (also known as a View), which is a top-level component mapped to a route.Component Composition: The Page component orchestrates a tree of smaller, reusable Components. These components are responsible for rendering the UI.State Management:For state that is confined to a single component or a small, related group of components, Composables are used. This keeps state co-located with the logic that uses it, enhancing encapsulation.For state that needs to be shared across disparate parts of the application (e.g., the current user's profile), components interact with global Pinia Stores.Business Logic & Data Fetching:Pinia stores or Page components delegate complex business logic or data fetching operations to a dedicated Services Layer. This layer abstracts the details of API communication.The Service layer uses a centralized API Client (built with Axios) to make HTTP requests to the backend API.Crucially, the API Client uses Zod schemas to parse and validate the response from the backend, ensuring that the data conforms to the application's expected types before it is passed back to the service and into the application state.This layered approach ensures that each part of the system has a single responsibility, making the application easier to reason about, test, and scale.Project Setup & ConfigurationA solid foundation is critical. The official Vue project scaffolding tool, create-vue, provides an excellent starting point that we will build upon with stricter configurations and additional production-grade dependencies.Scaffolding the ProjectBegin by scaffolding a new project using npm create vue@latest. This command initiates an interactive setup process. For a production-grade application, select the following options:TypeScript: YesJSX Support: No (unless specifically required)Vue Router for Single Page Application development: YesPinia for state management: YesVitest for Unit Testing: YesPlaywright for End-to-End testing: YesESLint for code quality: YesPrettier for code formatting: YesThis can be done non-interactively with the following command:Additional DependenciesNext, install the necessary libraries for data fetching, validation, server state management, and security linting.Production-Grade Folder StructureA well-organized folder structure is crucial for maintainability. The following structure is recommended as it scales well for medium to large applications by grouping files by their functional purpose.This structure separates concerns clearly: components are for UI, stores and composables for state, services for logic, and pages for assembling these pieces into views.Strict tsconfig.json ConfigurationTypeScript's value is maximized when its strictest settings are enabled. The configuration generated by create-vue is a good start, but for production, we should enforce even stricter rules to catch more potential errors at compile time.Create or modify tsconfig.json in the project root:And update tsconfig.app.json to be the primary configuration for your application code with the following strict options:Key Configuration Justifications:"strict": true: Enables all strict type-checking options, which is the single most important setting for a robust TypeScript project."noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true: Adds | undefined to any property accessed via an index signature, forcing you to handle cases where an object key or array index might not exist."exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true: Prevents undefined from being assigned to optional properties, making the distinction between a missing property and a property with the value undefined explicit."verbatimModuleSyntax": true: This is the modern replacement for isolatedModules and is crucial for Vite projects. It ensures that your code is compatible with transpilers like esbuild that operate on a single-file basis."paths": { "@/*": ["./src/*"] }: This mirrors the path alias we will configure in Vite, providing type-safe, absolute-style imports for the TypeScript language server.Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)Vite's configuration file allows us to define path aliases, handle environment variables, and fine-tune the build process.Key Configuration Justifications:resolve.alias: Defines the @ alias to point to the src directory. This simplifies imports throughout the project and makes refactoring easier.server.port and preview.port: Explicitly setting ports for development and preview environments avoids conflicts and ensures predictability.ESLint & Prettier ConfigurationAutomated linting and formatting are non-negotiable for maintaining code quality in a team setting. The create-vue scaffold provides a solid base. We will enhance it by adding the security plugin.Create a .prettierrc.json file in the root to configure Prettier's formatting rules:Key Configuration Justifications:plugin:security/recommended: This ESLint plugin detects potential security vulnerabilities directly in your code, such as the use of eval or insecure regular expressions. Catching these issues early in the development cycle is far more effective than finding them in production.@vue/eslint-config-prettier/skip-formatting: This is the modern way to integrate Prettier, ensuring it only handles formatting while ESLint focuses on code quality, preventing conflicts between the two tools.Core Best Practices: Mastering Vue 3 & TypeScriptAdhering to a consistent set of core practices is essential for writing clean, performant, and maintainable Vue code. The Composition API, especially with <script setup>, provides a powerful and ergonomic foundation.The <script setup> ParadigmThe <script setup> syntax is the recommended approach for using the Composition API in Single File Components (SFCs). It offers significant advantages :Conciseness: Less boilerplate compared to the standard setup() function. Variables, imports, and functions are directly available to the template.Performance: The template is compiled into a render function within the same scope, avoiding the performance overhead of a this proxy.Type Safety: Enables superior type inference and allows for declaring props and emits using pure TypeScript syntax.A well-structured <script setup> block enhances readability. Follow this conventional order:This logical grouping—from dependencies to state, derivations, side effects, and actions—makes components predictable and easier to navigate.TypeScript Strictness and Advanced TypesLeverage TypeScript's advanced features to model your data and state more accurately:as const: Use for creating readonly types from object literals or arrays. This is useful for defining constants that should never be mutated.satisfies: A powerful operator that allows you to validate that an expression matches a certain type without changing the resulting type of that expression. This is excellent for ensuring an object conforms to a general type while preserving its specific literal type.Discriminated Unions: The best way to model state that can be one of several distinct shapes, often used for state machines.Reactivity Deep DiveVue's reactivity system is powerful but has nuances that can lead to performance issues or bugs if misunderstood.ref vs. reactiveref<T>: Creates a reactive "box" that can hold any value type (string, number, object, etc.). The value is accessed and mutated via the .value property.reactive<T>(): Only works for object types (objects, arrays, Maps, Sets). It returns a reactive proxy of the object itself. Properties are accessed directly.Opinionated Best Practice: Prefer ref for all reactive state, including objects.While reactive may seem more ergonomic for objects because it avoids .value, it has significant pitfalls that make ref a safer and more consistent choice :Loss of Reactivity on Reassignment: You cannot replace an entire reactive object, as this breaks the reactive connection for any existing references to it. A ref can be reassigned at will (myRef.value = newObject).Loss of Reactivity on Destructuring: Destructuring properties from a reactive object disconnects them from the source, causing them to lose reactivity. This is a common source of bugs. ref does not have this issue as you are always working with the ref object itself.Shallow vs. Deep ReactivityBy default, both ref and reactive create deep reactive objects. For large, complex objects or data from external libraries where deep reactivity is unnecessary and computationally expensive, use their shallow counterparts:shallowRef: Only the .value assignment is tracked. The inner value of the object is not made reactive. This is ideal for large, immutable data structures. To trigger an update, you must replace the entire .value.shallowReactive: Only the root-level properties of the object are reactive. Nested objects are not converted into proxies.computed for DerivationsAlways use computed properties for state that is derived from other reactive sources. They are declaratively defined, automatically cached based on their dependencies, and only re-evaluate when a dependency changes. This is far more efficient and readable than manually updating state in a watch callback.watch vs. watchEffectChoose the right tool for observing reactive changes:watch: Use when you need to:Observe a specific data source.Access both the previous and current values.Control when the watcher runs (e.g., with lazy: true).watchEffect: Use when you need to:Run a side effect that reactively depends on multiple sources.Let Vue track the dependencies automatically.Run the effect immediately upon creation.watchEffect is simpler for effects that track multiple dependencies, while watch provides more fine-grained control.Design Patterns for Scalable Front-EndsApplying established design patterns provides a shared vocabulary and proven solutions to common architectural problems. Within the context of Vue 3's Composition API, these patterns are often implemented in a more functional and flexible manner.Composable Functions (The "Hook" Pattern)Composables are the primary pattern for encapsulating and reusing stateful logic in Vue 3, effectively replacing Vue 2's mixins. A composable is simply a function that uses Composition API functions (ref, computed, onMounted, etc.) and returns state and methods.When/Why: Use a composable whenever you have logic that you want to reuse across multiple components. This could be for fetching data, tracking browser state (like window size), or managing a form.Container/Presentational PatternThis classic pattern separates components into two distinct roles to improve reusability and separation of concerns :Presentational (Dumb) Components: Concerned with how things look. They receive data via props and emit events. They have no knowledge of where the data comes from or how it is mutated.Container (Smart) Components: Concerned with how things work. They manage state, fetch data, and contain the business logic.Modern Implementation with Composables: In Vue 3, the "Container" is often not a component but a composable. A page or view component uses one or more composables to manage logic and data, and then passes that data as props to purely presentational child components. This achieves the same separation with less boilerplate and greater reusability of the logic.Repository/Adapter PatternThis pattern abstracts the data source from the application's business logic. The application interacts with a generic Repository interface, while concrete implementations handle the specifics of communicating with a REST API, GraphQL, localStorage, or a mock data source.When/Why: Use this pattern when you want to decouple your application from a specific data-fetching technology or when you need to support multiple data sources. It is invaluable for testing, as you can easily swap the real API repository with a mock implementation.State Machine PatternFor complex UI components with multiple, mutually exclusive states (e.g., idle, loading, success, error, editing), a state machine is superior to a collection of boolean flags (isLoading, isError, etc.). It prevents impossible states and makes logic more explicit and predictable.When/Why: Use a state machine for components like multi-step wizards, complex forms, or data loaders that have distinct, finite states and well-defined transitions between them. XState is the industry-standard library for implementing state machines and integrates well with Vue.Strategy PatternThis behavioral pattern enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.When/Why: Use this when you have multiple ways to perform a task and want to switch between them dynamically. For example, a data visualization component might accept different rendering "strategies" (e.g., render as a table, render as a bar chart) that can be swapped by the user.Facade PatternA Facade provides a simplified, unified interface to a more complex subsystem. It hides the underlying complexity and makes the subsystem easier to use.When/Why: Use a Facade when you have a complex set of underlying APIs or services that you want to expose to the rest of the application through a simple, single entry point. A useNotifications composable that abstracts away different types of UI notifications (toasts, modals, alerts) is a perfect example.Observer/Event Bus PatternThis pattern allows objects to subscribe to and receive notifications about events. In Vue, it's used for communication between components that are not directly related via parent-child props/emits.When/Why: While a global event bus was common in Vue 2, it is now often considered an anti-pattern as it can make data flow difficult to trace. For most cross-component communication, Pinia is the preferred solution. However, for decoupled systems where you want to broadcast events without creating state dependencies (e.g., analytics, logging), a lightweight, typed event bus can be appropriate. VueUse's useEventBus is a modern, composable-based implementation that is recommended for these limited use cases.State Management & Data FetchingEffective state management is a cornerstone of a scalable application. Our recommended strategy provides a clear mental model for deciding where state should live, balancing encapsulation with accessibility.The "Local vs. Shared" State StrategyThe core principle is to use the right tool for the job, based on the scope and lifetime of the state:Local/Feature State with Composables: Use composables for state that is tightly coupled to a specific component or feature. Each component instance that uses the composable gets its own isolated state. This is the default and preferred approach as it promotes encapsulation and is more performant.Use Cases: UI state (e.g., isModalOpen), form data, and data fetched for a specific view that is not needed elsewhere.Global/Shared State with Pinia: Use Pinia for state that is truly global and needs to be accessed and modified by multiple, unrelated components across the application. Pinia provides a single source of truth, DevTools integration, and robust TypeScript support.Use Cases: Authenticated user data, shopping cart contents, application-wide settings (e.g., theme).This strategy prevents the common pitfalls of over-using a global store for trivial UI state or resorting to complex prop-drilling for state that needs to be shared across a few components.Implementing Fully-Typed Pinia StoresPinia stores should be defined using the "setup store" syntax, as it aligns with the Composition API mental model. This involves using ref() for state, computed() for getters, and functions for actions.Advanced Data Fetching with TanStack Query (Vue Query)While Pinia is excellent for client state, server state (data fetched from an API) has different characteristics: it's asynchronous, can become stale, and is stored remotely. TanStack Query (Vue Query) is a purpose-built library for managing server state.When/Why: Use Vue Query for any data fetching that would benefit from caching, automatic refetching, and streamlined loading/error state management. It dramatically simplifies data-fetching logic and improves user experience by keeping data fresh.Here is a composable that uses Vue Query to fetch user data:This composable handles caching (keyed by ['user', userId]), loading and error states, and will automatically refetch data based on its configuration, all with minimal boilerplate.The Type-Safe API LayerA type-safe API layer is the bedrock of a reliable front-end application. It acts as a protective boundary, ensuring that data from external sources is validated and conforms to the application's types before it enters the state management system. This layer consists of a centralized Axios client and runtime validators using Zod.Designing a Centralized API ServiceCentralize all API-related configuration in a single module. This makes it easy to manage base URLs, headers, and other settings.Configuring Axios InterceptorsInterceptors allow you to run code globally for every request or response. This is the perfect place to handle authentication tokens and global error handling.Integrating Zod for Runtime ValidationTypeScript provides compile-time type safety, but it offers no protection against malformed data from an API at runtime. An API could change its contract, sending a string where a number is expected. This is where Zod is indispensable. It validates the actual data as it arrives, creating a truly robust application boundary.We can create schemas that define the expected shape of our data and then infer TypeScript types directly from them, ensuring our validators and types are never out of sync.Now, we can use this schema in our repository/service layer to parse and validate the API response:If the data received from the API does not match the UserSchema, Zod will throw a detailed error, which can be caught and handled gracefully, preventing corrupted data from ever reaching your application's state.UI/UX FoundationsA robust application must also provide a seamless and accessible user experience. This involves a well-structured routing system, adherence to accessibility standards, support for internationalization, and reliable forms.Routing with Vue Router 4Vue Router is the official routing library for Vue. A production setup should prioritize performance and security.Key Practices:Route-level Code Splitting: Use dynamic import() to lazy-load route components. This splits the application into smaller chunks that are only loaded when the user navigates to that route, dramatically improving initial page load time.Authentication Guards: Use router.beforeEach to implement global navigation guards. By checking route meta fields, you can protect routes that require authentication.Accessibility (a11y)Accessibility is not an optional feature; it is a core requirement for building inclusive web applications.Key Practices:Semantic HTML: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (<nav>, <main>, <button>). This provides a meaningful structure for assistive technologies.WAI-ARIA Attributes: Enhance dynamic components with ARIA roles and attributes. For example, use role="dialog" and aria-modal="true" for modals, and aria-live="polite" for regions that display status updates.Focus Management: Programmatically manage focus to guide users. When a modal opens, focus should move to an element inside it. When it closes, focus should return to the element that opened it.Internationalization (i18n)For applications serving a global audience, vue-i18n is the standard library for internationalization.Key Practices:Typed Messages: Define your translation keys and message schemas in TypeScript. This provides autocompletion and compile-time checks, preventing typos and making maintenance easier.Lazy-load Locales: Load translation files dynamically to avoid bloating the initial application bundle.Forms & ValidationRobust form handling requires a combination of a form management library and a validation schema library.Recommended Stack: Vee-Validate for form state management and Zod for schema-based validation. This combination provides a fully type-safe and declarative way to build complex forms.Performance OptimizationWhile Vue 3 is fast by default, large-scale applications require conscious optimization efforts to ensure a smooth user experience. This involves strategies for efficient loading, rendering, and caching.Code-Splitting StrategiesCode splitting is the most impactful performance optimization for reducing initial load times. It breaks the application bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.Route-Level Splitting: As shown in the Vue Router section, lazy-loading routes is the primary method of code splitting. This ensures users only download the code for the page they are visiting.Component-Level Splitting: For components that are not immediately visible or are conditionally rendered (e.g., modals, complex popovers), use defineAsyncComponent. This creates a separate chunk for the component, which is only fetched when the component is about to be rendered.Caching MechanismsCaching prevents redundant work, both in the browser and on the server.<KeepAlive> Component Caching: Use the built-in <KeepAlive> component to cache component instances in memory. When a user navigates away from a kept-alive component and then returns, its state is preserved, and it does not need to be re-created. This is particularly useful for multi-tab interfaces or forms that should retain user input.Note: Components to be included must have an explicit name option.v-memo Directive: For fine-grained performance tuning, v-memo can be used to memoize a part of the template. It takes a dependency array and will only re-render the element if a dependency has changed. This is a micro-optimization and should only be used when a specific performance bottleneck has been identified, such as in a large v-for list.HTTP Caching: Configure your production web server (e.g., Nginx) to send appropriate Cache-Control headers.Hashed Assets (/assets/index-a1b2c3d4.js): These files have unique names based on their content. They can be cached aggressively and immutably for a long period (e.g., 1 year).index.html: This file is the entry point and should not be cached (no-cache) to ensure users always fetch the latest version, which will reference the new hashed assets upon deployment.Identifying and Mitigating Reactivity PitfallsOver-reactivity can be a source of performance issues.Avoid Deep Reactivity for Large Objects: As mentioned, use shallowRef for large, immutable data structures to prevent Vue from traversing and making every nested property reactive.Profile with Vue DevTools: The Vue DevTools extension includes a Performance tab that allows you to profile component render times and track reactivity updates. This is the primary tool for diagnosing performance bottlenecks in your components.A Multi-Layered Testing StrategyA comprehensive testing strategy is essential for building reliable software. It provides a safety net for refactoring, prevents regressions, and documents the application's behavior. We recommend a balanced approach that combines unit, component, and end-to-end tests.Unit Testing (Vitest)Unit tests focus on the smallest pieces of logic in isolation, such as individual functions in a composable or actions in a Pinia store. They should be fast and have no external dependencies (e.g., no network or DOM).Testing a Pinia Store:Component Testing (Vitest + Vue Test Utils)Component tests verify that a component renders correctly and behaves as expected based on its props and user interactions. They test the component's public contract (props, emits, slots) without testing its internal implementation details.Testing a Component's Props and Emits:End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Playwright)E2E tests simulate real user flows from start to finish in a real browser. They are the highest level of testing and should be reserved for critical application paths, such as login, registration, or a checkout process.Testing a Login Flow:Quality GatesIntegrate testing into your CI pipeline to act as a quality gate. Configure Vitest to enforce code coverage thresholds. If tests fail or coverage drops, the build should fail, preventing regressions from being merged.Tooling & Developer Experience (DX)A great developer experience is not a luxury; it is a key driver of productivity and code quality. Automating code standards and providing immediate feedback allows developers to focus on solving business problems.Linting & FormattingAs configured in the Project Setup section, ESLint and Prettier form the foundation of our automated code quality system.ESLint: Analyzes code to find and fix stylistic and programmatic errors.Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.To run these tools manually, add scripts to your package.json:Automating with Git Hooks (Husky & lint-staged)Manually running linters is fallible. Automating these checks with Git hooks ensures that no substandard code enters the codebase. Husky makes it easy to manage Git hooks, and lint-staged allows us to run scripts only on files that are staged for a commit.Setup Steps:Install dev dependencies:Initialize Husky:This creates a .husky/ directory and adds a prepare script to package.json.Configure lint-staged: Add the following to your package.json:Create the pre-commit hook: This hook will run lint-staged before every commit.Now, every time a developer runs git commit, lint-staged will automatically format and lint the staged files. This simple automation dramatically improves code consistency and quality with zero ongoing effort from the team.Security HardeningWeb application security is a multi-faceted discipline. For a front-end application, the primary concerns are protecting user data, preventing unauthorized actions, and ensuring the integrity of the application itself.Supply Chain SecurityYour application is only as secure as its dependencies.Lock Dependencies: Always use npm ci in your CI/CD pipelines instead of npm install. This installs dependencies exactly as specified in package-lock.json, ensuring reproducible and predictable builds.Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Enable Dependabot or a similar service (like Snyk) on your repository. These tools automatically scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities and create pull requests to upgrade them, making it easy to stay on top of security patches.Preventing DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOMXSS)DOMXSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into the DOM, which are then executed by the browser. While Vue automatically escapes most content, dynamically rendering user-provided HTML with v-html is a significant risk.Best Practice: Never render HTML from an untrusted source without sanitizing it first. Use a well-vetted library like DOMPurify to strip out any potentially malicious content.Content Security Policy (CSP)CSP is a powerful, defense-in-depth security layer that tells the browser which sources of content are trusted. A strict CSP can prevent many types of injection attacks, including XSS.Implementation: CSP is typically delivered via an HTTP header from your server, but for static sites or for ease of setup, it can be added as a <meta> tag in your index.html.Trade-offs: A strict CSP for production is essential, but it can interfere with development tools like Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Therefore, it's common to have a more lenient policy for development.Example CSP for Production:Secure Authentication FlowsHow you store authentication tokens on the client-side has significant security implications. The two main options are localStorage and cookies.Trade-offs Table :Recommended Approach: The Hybrid FlowThe most secure approach combines the strengths of both methods to protect against both XSS and CSRF :Refresh Token: Store the long-lived refresh token in a secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie. The server sets this cookie upon login. It is inaccessible to JavaScript, protecting it from XSS.Access Token: Store the short-lived access token in memory within your application (e.g., in a Pinia store). This token is used to authenticate API requests. Because it is not persisted, it is less vulnerable to XSS, and because it must be manually attached to requests via an Authorization header, it is not vulnerable to CSRF.Token Refresh: When the access token expires, or on application load, a dedicated API endpoint (/refresh_token) is called. This endpoint reads the HttpOnly refresh token cookie, validates it, and returns a new access token.This flow provides a robust security posture for modern SPAs.Build & Deployment PipelineA fully automated build and deployment pipeline ensures that every change is consistently tested, built, and deployed, reducing manual errors and increasing velocity.Optimizing the Vite Production BuildVite's build command is powered by Rollup and is highly configurable. For production, you should enable source maps and consider advanced chunking strategies.Source Maps: Generating source maps (sourcemap: true) is crucial for production. These maps should be uploaded to your error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) but not publicly exposed. This allows you to debug production errors with fully de-minified stack traces.Containerization with DockerContainerizing your application with Docker provides a consistent and portable environment for deployment. A multi-stage build is the best practice for front-end applications, as it results in a small and secure final image.Dockerfile:.dockerignore:nginx.conf:This configuration builds the application in a Node.js environment and then copies only the static dist output into a lightweight Nginx container. The Nginx configuration serves the files and includes a try_files directive to correctly handle SPA routing.Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub ActionsA CI pipeline automates the quality assurance process for every commit. The following workflow for GitHub Actions defines a sequence of jobs to lint, test, and build the application.Deployment StrategiesStatic Hosts (Vercel, Netlify): Ideal for simple deployments. Connect your GitHub repository, and these platforms will automatically run your build command and deploy the contents of the dist directory. You will need to configure their platform-specific settings to handle SPA routing (i.e., redirect all paths to index.html).Container Platforms (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Fly.io): For more control and scalability, your CI pipeline can be extended to build the Docker image, push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry), and then trigger a deployment on one of these platforms. This approach is more complex but offers greater flexibility.Appendix A: Full Project File TreeAppendix B: References & Further Readingcreate-vue - GitHub - 2024-10-27 -  Vue Official Tooling Guide -
